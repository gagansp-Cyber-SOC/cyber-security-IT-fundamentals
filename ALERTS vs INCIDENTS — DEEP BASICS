# 🚨 SOC ALERTS vs INCIDENTS — DEEP BASICS (WHY • WHAT • WHEN • HOW)

> **Audience:** SOC L1–L2 (Defensive)
>
> **Goal:** Teach analysts to think before escalating
>
> **Core Truth:** Most SOC failures happen **between alert creation and incident declaration**

---

## 🚨 1️⃣ WHAT IS AN ALERT

### 🔹 WHAT

An **alert** is a **signal** generated by a tool when a rule, threshold, or behavior is matched

Alerts are based on:

* Signatures
* Rules
* Heuristics
* Machine learning

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Alerts are **starting points**, not conclusions

> Alert ≠ Attack

### 🔹 WHERE ALERTS COME FROM

* SIEM
* EDR
* Firewall
* IdP
* DLP

### 🔹 SAMPLE ALERT

```
Alert: Multiple Failed Logins
User: gagan
Count: 6
Source IP: 185.x.x.x
```

SOC question

* Normal user behavior?
* Known IP?

---

## 🔥 2️⃣ WHAT IS AN INCIDENT

### 🔹 WHAT

An **incident** is a **confirmed security event** that:

* Violates policy
* Impacts confidentiality, integrity, or availability

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Incidents trigger:

* Response actions
* Containment
* Reporting

### 🔹 INCIDENT REQUIRES

* Evidence
* Context
* Impact

---

## ⚖️ 3️⃣ FALSE POSITIVES vs TRUE POSITIVES

### 🔹 FALSE POSITIVE

Alert triggered, **no malicious activity**

Examples

* User forgot password
* VPN reconnects
* Patch scans

### 🔹 TRUE POSITIVE

Alert represents **real malicious activity**

Examples

* Password spraying
* Malware execution

### 🔹 WHY THIS MATTERS

Escalating false positives:

* Wastes IR time
* Burns trust

---

## 🚦 4️⃣ SEVERITY vs PRIORITY

### 🔹 SEVERITY

How **bad** the event could be

Set by:

* Detection logic
* Tool

### 🔹 PRIORITY

How **urgent** it is **right now**

Set by SOC analyst

### 🔹 EXAMPLE

* Severity: High (Admin login)
* Priority: Low (Known jump host)

---

## 🧠 5️⃣ TRIAGE MINDSET (MOST IMPORTANT)

### 🔹 SOC TRIAGE QUESTIONS

Always ask:

1. Is this expected behavior?
2. Is the source trusted?
3. Is there impact?
4. Is there progression?

### 🔹 WHAT TO CHECK FIRST

* User
* Source IP
* Time
* Asset criticality

### 🔹 SAMPLE TRIAGE FLOW

```
Alert → Validate → Correlate → Decide
```

---

## 🚨 6️⃣ WHEN TO ESCALATE

### 🔹 ESCALATE WHEN

* Clear attacker intent
* Privileged access involved
* Lateral movement seen
* Data access confirmed

### 🔹 DO NOT ESCALATE WHEN

* Single isolated alert
* Known maintenance
* No impact

---

## 🧠 FINAL SOC RULE

> **Every incident starts as an alert**
>
> **But most alerts should never become incidents**

Good analysts reduce incidents
Great analysts reduce **noise**
