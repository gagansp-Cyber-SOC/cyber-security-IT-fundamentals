# 📜 SOC LOGGING & TELEMETRY — BEYOND OS (WHY • WHAT • WHERE • HOW)

> **Audience:** SOC L1–L2 (Defensive)
>
> **Goal:** Know which logs actually matter, why alerts fail, and where blind spots exist
>
> **Core Truth:** SOC does not fail because of tools — it fails because of **missing or misunderstood logs**

## 🧠 1️⃣ WHAT LOGS MATTER MOST IN SOC (PRIORITY VIEW)

### 🔹 WHAT

Not all logs are equal. Some logs **prove attacker intent**, others only show noise

### 🔹 SOC LOG PRIORITY (REAL WORLD)

| Priority    | Log Type         | Why It Matters           |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| 🔥 Critical | Identity logs    | Proves who accessed what |
| 🔥 Critical | Network logs     | Shows movement & exfil   |
| High        | Endpoint logs    | Execution & persistence  |
| Medium      | Application logs | Abuse of business apps   |
| Low         | System info logs | Context only             |

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Most breaches involve

* Valid credentials
* Legit traffic
* Normal tools

Only **correlated logs** expose abuse

---

## 🪟 2️⃣ WINDOWS LOGS (BEYOND BASICS)

### 🔹 WHAT MATTERS MOST

**Security Log (Non‑Negotiable)**

Key Event IDs

* 4624 → Successful logon
* 4625 → Failed logon
* 4672 → Privileged logon
* 4688 → Process creation
* 4728 → Group membership change

### 🔹 WHERE

```
Event Viewer → Windows Logs → Security
```

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Shows

* Credential abuse
* Privilege escalation
* Lateral movement

### 🔹 SAMPLE

```
EventID=4688
NewProcess=cmd.exe
ParentProcess=winword.exe
```

SOC thought

* Why Word spawning cmd?

## 🐧 3️⃣ LINUX LOGS (SOC VIEW)

### 🔹 AUTH LOGS

| OS            | Path              |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Ubuntu/Debian | /var/log/auth.log |
| RHEL/CentOS   | /var/log/secure   |

### 🔹 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

* SSH brute force
* Sudo abuse

### 🔹 SAMPLE

```
Failed password for root from 185.x.x.x
```

---

## 🌐 4️⃣ NETWORK LOGS (FIREWALL • PROXY • FLOW)

### 🔹 WHAT THEY SHOW

* Who talked to whom
* When
* How much data

### 🔹 FIREWALL LOG SAMPLE

```
SRC=10.0.0.8 DST=45.x.x.x DPT=443 ACTION=ALLOW
```

SOC question

* Normal destination?
* Data volume?

### 🔹 FLOW LOG SAMPLE

```
bytes=987654 duration=900s
```

---

## 📦 5️⃣ APPLICATION LOGS

### 🔹 WHAT

Logs generated by business apps

Examples

* Email
* CRM
* ERP

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Attackers abuse apps

* BEC
* API abuse
* Data theft

### 🔹 SAMPLE

```
User=gagan Action=Download File=finance.xlsx
```

---

## ☁️ 6️⃣ CLOUD LOGS

### 🔹 WHAT MATTERS

**Identity logs (Top Priority)**

* Sign‑in
* Token issuance
* MFA result

**Audit logs**

* Role changes
* Resource access

### 🔹 SAMPLE

```
User=gagan App=SharePoint Result=Success IP=185.x.x.x
```

SOC thought

* Known IP?
* Risk flagged?

---

## 🔄 7️⃣ NORMALIZATION & PARSING

### 🔹 WHAT

Converting different log formats into common fields

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Bad parsing = bad detection

### 🔹 EXAMPLE

Raw

```
UserName=gagan.s
```

Parsed

```
user=gagan
```

Mismatch breaks correlation

---

## 🕳️ 8️⃣ LOG GAPS & BLIND SPOTS

### 🔹 COMMON GAPS

* No DNS logs
* No VPN logs
* No EDR telemetry
* Local logs not forwarded

### 🔹 WHY THIS IS DANGEROUS

Attackers live in gaps

SOC question

* "Can we even see this activity?"

---

## 🧠 FINAL SOC RULE

> **If it is not logged, it did not happen — for the SOC**
> No log = no detection = no incident
