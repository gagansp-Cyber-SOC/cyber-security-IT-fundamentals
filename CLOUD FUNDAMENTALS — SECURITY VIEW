# ☁️ SOC CLOUD FUNDAMENTALS — SECURITY VIEW (WHY • WHAT • WHERE • HOW)

> **Audience:** SOC L1–L2 (Defensive)
>
> **Goal:** Help SOC analysts investigate cloud activity the same way they investigate on‑prem incidents
>
> **Core Truth:** In the cloud, **identity is the perimeter and logs are the only visibility**

## 🏗️ 1️⃣ IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS (SOC VIEW, NOT MARKETING)

### 🔹 WHAT THEY MEAN

| Model | What Customer Manages | What Provider Manages | SOC Impact                      |
| ----- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| IaaS  | OS, apps, identity    | Hardware, hypervisor  | Similar to on‑prem + cloud logs |
| PaaS  | App logic, identity   | OS, runtime, infra    | Limited host visibility         |
| SaaS  | Identity, data usage  | Everything else       | Logs = only evidence            |

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Visibility reduces as you move:

```
IaaS → PaaS → SaaS
```

SOC must rely more on:

* Identity logs
* Audit logs

## 🤝 2️⃣ SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL

### 🔹 WHAT

Security responsibility is **split**, not transferred

### 🔹 COMMON SOC MISTAKE

"Cloud provider secures everything" ❌

### 🔹 REALITY (SECURITY VIEW)

| Area               | Customer | Provider |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| Identity & access  | ✅        | ❌        |
| Data protection    | ✅        | ❌        |
| OS patching (IaaS) | ✅        | ❌        |
| Physical DC        | ❌        | ✅        |

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Most cloud breaches occur due to **customer misconfiguration**

---

## 👤 3️⃣ CLOUD IDENTITY‑FIRST SECURITY

### 🔹 WHAT

Cloud access is controlled by:

* Users
* Roles
* Tokens
* APIs

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

No internal network trust

Attackers target:

* Credentials
* Tokens
* API keys

### 🔹 COMMON ATTACKS

* OAuth abuse
* Token theft
* MFA fatigue

---

## 📜 4️⃣ CLOUD LOGGING BASICS (NON‑NEGOTIABLE)

### 🔹 WHAT LOGS MATTER MOST

**Identity logs (Top Priority)**

* Sign‑ins
* MFA results
* Token issuance

**Audit logs**

* Role changes
* Resource access

**Service logs**

* Storage access
* API calls

### 🔹 WHERE TO LOOK

Examples

* Azure AD / Entra ID logs
* AWS CloudTrail
* Google Cloud Audit Logs

### 🔹 SAMPLE LOG

```
User=gagan
Action=LoginSuccess
App=SharePoint
IP=185.x.x.x
```

SOC questions

* Known IP?
* MFA used?

---

## 🧨 5️⃣ COMMON CLOUD MISCONFIGURATIONS (SOC HOTSPOTS)

### 🔹 IDENTITY MISCONFIGS

* MFA not enforced
* Excessive admin roles

### 🔹 STORAGE MISCONFIGS

* Public buckets
* Over‑permissive access

### 🔹 NETWORK MISCONFIGS

* Open security groups
* Wide IP ranges (0.0.0.0/0)

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Misconfigs are exploited without malware

---

## 🔍 6️⃣ CLOUD INVESTIGATION MINDSET (MISSING AREA)

### 🔹 SOC QUESTIONS

* Who accessed the resource?
* From where?
* With what role?
* Was it expected?

### 🔹 CORRELATION EXAMPLE

```
Cloud login → API call → Data download
```

---

## 🧠 FINAL SOC RULE

> **In cloud incidents, identity logs replace packet captures**

If identity logs are missing, the investigation is blind
