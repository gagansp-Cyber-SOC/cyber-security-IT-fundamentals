# 🔍 SOC INVESTIGATION FUNDAMENTALS — DEEP BASICS (WHY • WHAT • HOW)

> **Audience:** SOC L1–L2 (Defensive)
>
> **Goal:** Teach analysts *how to think* during an investigation, not just what to click
>
> **Core Truth:** Tools don’t investigate — **analysts do**

## 🧭 1️⃣ INVESTIGATION FLOW (NON‑NEGOTIABLE)

### 🔹 WHAT

A **structured path** from alert to conclusion

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Without a flow:

* Analysts jump randomly
* Evidence gets missed
* Wrong conclusions are made

### 🔹 STANDARD FLOW

```
Alert → Validate → Scope → Correlate → Confirm → Decide
```

### 🔹 WHAT EACH STEP MEANS

* **Validate** → Is the alert real?
* **Scope** → How big is this?
* **Correlate** → What else is related?
* **Confirm** → Malicious or benign?
* **Decide** → Close, contain, escalate

---

## ⏱️ 2️⃣ TIMELINE BUILDING (INVESTIGATION BACKBONE)

### 🔹 WHAT

A **chronological reconstruction** of events

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Attackers rely on:

* Speed
* Confusion
* Noise

Timelines restore **clarity**

### 🔹 HOW TO BUILD

Always normalize to:

* UTC
* Single time window

### 🔹 EXAMPLE

```
10:02 Failed login
10:04 VPN success
10:07 Admin group add
```

SOC question

* Is this progression logical?

---

## 🧾 3️⃣ EVIDENCE COLLECTION

### 🔹 WHAT COUNTS AS EVIDENCE

* Logs
* Screenshots
* Hashes
* Command output

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Poor evidence = weak incident response

### 🔹 RULES

* Do not modify originals
* Record timestamps
* Keep source info

### 🔹 EXAMPLE

```
Log Source: AD Security
Event ID: 4728
Time: 10:07 UTC
```

---

## 🧩 4️⃣ CORRELATION THINKING

### 🔹 WHAT

Connecting **multiple weak signals** into one strong conclusion

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Single alerts lie
Correlation reveals intent

### 🔹 EXAMPLE

```
EDR alert + VPN login + DNS anomaly
```

SOC insight

* Separate events → noise
* Together → attack

---

## 🧠 5️⃣ HYPOTHESIS‑BASED ANALYSIS

### 🔹 WHAT

Start with a theory, then prove or disprove it

### 🔹 EXAMPLE HYPOTHESIS

"This account is compromised"

### 🔹 HOW TO TEST

* Look for lateral movement
* Check privilege changes
* Validate data access

### 🔹 WHY THIS WORKS

Prevents tunnel vision

---

## 📝 6️⃣ DOCUMENTATION & REPORTING

### 🔹 WHY THIS MATTERS

If it’s not documented:

* It didn’t happen
* It can’t be defended

### 🔹 WHAT TO DOCUMENT

* What happened
* How it was detected
* Evidence
* Decision made

### 🔹 SIMPLE FORMAT

```
Summary
Timeline
Findings
Conclusion
```

---

## 🧠 FINAL SOC RULE

> **An investigation is successful when the conclusion is defensible**

Not when it is fast
Not when it looks busy
