# 🧪 SOC ENDPOINT SECURITY FUNDAMENTALS — COMPLETE DEEP BASICS (WHY • WHAT • WHERE • HOW)

> **Audience:** SOC L1–L2 (Defensive)
>
> **Goal:** Enable analysts to correctly interpret endpoint alerts, understand attacker behavior, and take the right response action
>
> **Core Truth:** Endpoint alerts are evidence — not verdicts

## 🛡️ 1️⃣ ANTIVIRUS vs EDR vs MDR vs XDR (REAL SOC VIEW)

### 🔹 WHAT THEY ARE

| Technology     | What It Actually Does            | SOC Reality                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Antivirus (AV) | Signature + basic heuristics     | Stops known malware only        |
| EDR            | Behavioral telemetry + response  | Primary investigation tool      |
| MDR            | EDR + human monitoring           | Outsourced detection & response |
| XDR            | Correlates endpoint + other logs | Detection enrichment layer      |

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Misunderstanding leads to:

* Assuming protection exists when it doesn’t
* Ignoring high‑value alerts

---

## 🚦 2️⃣ DETECTION vs PREVENTION

### 🔹 DETECTION

Identifies suspicious or malicious behavior

Examples

* Encoded PowerShell
* LSASS access attempt

### 🔹 PREVENTION

Stops execution or blocks behavior

Examples

* Malware execution blocked
* Script terminated

### 🔹 SOC RULE

> A blocked attack is still an **attack attempt**

Detection without prevention = visibility
Prevention without detection = blind confidence

---

## 🔒 3️⃣ QUARANTINE vs CONTAINMENT vs ISOLATION

### 🔹 QUARANTINE (FILE LEVEL)

* Removes file access
* File moved to secure location

### 🔹 CONTAINMENT (PROCESS / BEHAVIOR)

* Stops execution or persistence
* Limits attacker actions

### 🔹 ISOLATION (NETWORK LEVEL)

* Endpoint cut off from network
* Used during active compromise

### 🔹 WHEN TO ISOLATE

* Credential theft detected
* Lateral movement observed

## 🧨 4️⃣ ENDPOINT ATTACK TECHNIQUES (DEFENSIVE VIEW)

| Technique          | What Attacker Does | SOC Signal         |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Initial execution  | User runs payload  | Office → shell     |
| LOLBins abuse      | Native tools       | powershell.exe     |
| Credential dumping | Steal creds        | LSASS access       |
| Persistence        | Maintain access    | Startup / registry |
| Lateral movement   | Move internally    | PsExec / RDP       |

## 🚨 5️⃣ EDR ALERTS — HOW TO READ THEM

### 🔹 WHAT EDR SHOWS

* Process tree
* Command line
* Parent‑child relationships
* Network connections

### 🔹 SAMPLE ALERT

```
ParentProcess: winword.exe
ChildProcess: powershell.exe
CommandLine: powershell -enc SQBFAFgA
```

### 🔹 SOC QUESTIONS

* User‑initiated or automated?
* Encoded or obfuscated?
* Known admin activity?

---

## 🧠 6️⃣ CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS (MISSING AREA)

### 🔹 CONTEXT INCLUDES

* User role
* Device role
* Time of activity
* Network destination

### 🔹 WHY IT MATTERS

Same alert can be:

* Benign on IT admin system
* Critical on finance user laptop

---

## 🔁 7️⃣ FALSE POSITIVES IN ENDPOINT SECURITY (MISSING AREA)

### 🔹 COMMON SOURCES

* IT scripts
* Backup agents
* Patch management tools

### 🔹 HOW TO VALIDATE

* Check file signer
* Verify command purpose

---

## 🧾 8️⃣ ENDPOINT LOGS & TELEMETRY (MISSING AREA)

### 🔹 WINDOWS

| Log        | Path                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Security   | Event Viewer → Security |
| PowerShell | Event ID 4104           |
| Sysmon     | Event ID 1, 3, 7        |

### 🔹 LINUX

```
/var/log/syslog
/var/log/auth.log
```

---

## 🧪 9️⃣ EVIDENCE COLLECTION FROM ENDPOINTS

### 🔹 WHAT TO COLLECT

* Process tree screenshot
* File hash
* Command line
* Network connections

### 🔹 WHY SOC CARES

Evidence supports:

* Escalation
* Containment
* Legal review

---

## 🔄 🔟 ENDPOINT → NETWORK → IDENTITY CORRELATION (MISSING AREA)

### 🔹 EXAMPLE

```
EDR alert → VPN login → AD privilege change
```

Single alert = weak signal
Correlated = confirmed attack

---

## 🧠 FINAL SOC RULE

> **Endpoints show the attacker’s hands — not their full plan**

Correlation reveals intent
