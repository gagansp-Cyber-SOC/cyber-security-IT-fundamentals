# Windows vs Linux vs macOS 

---

## 🪟 Windows

### 🔹 What

Windows is the most widely used OS in **enterprise environments**, especially for:

* User endpoints
* Active Directory
* File and application servers

---

### 🔹 Where to check

* User workstations
* Domain controllers
* Application servers

---

### 🔹 How to check

```cmd
winver
systeminfo
```

---

### 🔹 Why SOC checks Windows

* Primary target for malware and ransomware
* Deep integration with Active Directory
* Rich logging (Event IDs)

---

### 🔹 Important paths

```
C:\Windows\System32\
C:\Users\
C:\ProgramData\
```

---

### 🔹 Sample logs

**Security Event Log**

```
Event ID 4624 – Successful logon
Event ID 4625 – Failed logon
Event ID 4688 – Process creation
```

---

### 🔹 Common attack focus

* LSASS dumping
* Registry persistence
* PowerShell abuse

---

### 🔹 3rd-party applications

* EDR tools (CrowdStrike, Defender, SentinelOne)
* Sysinternals (Process Explorer, Autoruns)
* SIEM agents

---

## 🐧 Linux

### 🔹 What

Linux is dominant in:

* Servers
* Cloud infrastructure
* Containers

---

### 🔹 Where to check

* Web servers
* Database servers
* Cloud VMs

---

### 🔹 How to check

```bash
uname -a
cat /etc/os-release
```

---

### 🔹 Why SOC checks Linux

* SSH brute force is very common
* Often internet-facing
* Less default logging than Windows

---

### 🔹 Important paths

```
/etc/
/var/log/
/home/
/tmp/
/usr/bin/
```

---

### 🔹 Sample logs

```
/var/log/auth.log   (Debian/Ubuntu)
Failed password for user root
```

```
/var/log/secure     (RHEL/CentOS)
```

---

### 🔹 Common attack focus

* SSH key abuse
* Cron persistence
* Crypto miners

---

### 🔹 3rd-party applications

* Auditd
* OSQuery
* Falco
* Cloud monitoring agents

---

## 🍎 macOS

### 🔹 What

macOS is mainly used for:

* Developer machines
* Corporate laptops

---

### 🔹 Where to check

* Employee endpoints
* Developer systems

---

### 🔹 How to check

```bash
sw_vers
```

---

### 🔹 Why SOC checks macOS

* Increasing phishing and malware
* Often overlooked in security coverage

---

### 🔹 Important paths

```
/Applications/
/Users/
/Library/
/System/Library/
```

---

### 🔹 Sample logs

```bash
log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "authentication"' --last 1d
```

---

### 🔹 Common attack focus

* LaunchAgents persistence
* Browser credential theft

---

### 🔹 3rd-party applications

* Jamf
* EDR agents
* OSQuery

| Area             | Windows           | Linux       | macOS                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Enterprise usage | Very High         | High        | Medium                |
| Logging          | Very rich         | Moderate    | Moderate              |
| Common attacks   | Malware, AD abuse | SSH, miners | Phishing, persistence |
| SOC priority     | Highest           | High        | Medium                |

## 🧠 SOC Mindset

If you know:

* OS type
* Log locations
* Common attack paths

You can **triage alerts faster and smarter**, regardless of tools.
